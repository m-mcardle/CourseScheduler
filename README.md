# Sprint 3
This branch contains the code that was created by team 205 to meet requirements for sprint three. This sprint was an add on to the second sprint which still involves using VBA to suggest classes for schedules. View the full guidelines here.

### Course Selection With Helper
Our project for sprint 3 was built by modifying our Python parser from sprint one and our course selection Excel VBA from sprint two. The project for this sprint lets users build their course schedule for University of Guelph courses similar to the last sprint except now there is added functionality which allows users to suggest courses based on various filters. The Excel spreadsheet allows users to enter up to five courses and use a filter to suggest any number of missing courses up to 5 and display the generated schedule.

Full design documentation for this project can be found in the GitLab Wiki.
