# Sprint 2
This repository contains the code required for Sprint 2. This sprint involves creating a VBA tool for an Excel spreadsheet to dynamically create class schedules. View the full guidelines [here](https://gitlab.socs.uoguelph.ca/groups/cis3760_team205/-/wikis/Sprint-Two-Description).

### Course Selection
Our project for sprint 2 was built using Excel VBA. This project lets users build their course schedule for University of Guelph courses with up to five different courses from a CSV file that was generated in [sprint one](https://gitlab.socs.uoguelph.ca/cis3760_team205/sprint-1). The spreadsheet allows users to enter five courses and it display the generated schedule, 

Full design documentation for this project is available [here](https://gitlab.socs.uoguelph.ca/cis3760_team205/sprint-2/-/wikis/Sprint-2-Design-Doc).
